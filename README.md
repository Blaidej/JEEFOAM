# JEEFOAM
A version of a Athlete management system using JEE
Built the bean, the servlet and the JSP's needed to be able to maintian a roster. Has the capabilities to Display all the athletes 
on the roster. A user can also add, edit or delete athletes. Validation is used verify most of the data. On initial push to GIT, I
have left the design parts of the interface alone almost completely.
